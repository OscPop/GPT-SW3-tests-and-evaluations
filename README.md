# Trying out GPT-SW3
Trying out the latest instruction tuned GPT models from AI Sweden. The main interest is to see how it compares to ChatGPT and GPT-4 when it comes to the Swedish language. 

<br><br>

# GPT-4
There are currently two ways of getting access to GPT-4. Either through becoming a GPT+ subscriber to OpenAI or by paying for OpenAI API usage. The easiest to use is the GPT+ subscription which let's you interact directly with GPT-4 in the browser.

A thing to note about using GPT-4 in the browser is that you can't control the various parameters that go into the model, such as temperature and repetition penalty etc. This makes it convenient and easy for the casual user, but limits the exploring capabilities for the more invested users.
